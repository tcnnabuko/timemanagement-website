		<h1> Time Management </h1>
		<h2> What is Time Management? </h2>
		<p> Time management is the act of using your time wisely rather than wasting it. It involves taking into 
		account steps needed to take in order in succeed in our everyday lives. You may need to
		initiate several time management strategies that help you avoid distractions and focus on the
		task at hand.</p>
		
		<h3> Causes of poor time management </h3> <img src= "https://i0.wp.com/www.executivepasolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/

		<p> As human beings, it is easy to give up on working towards our goals or don't even feel like doing anything
		at all. Listed below are the main causes of poor time management</p> 
		<p><h3> Lack of motivation: </h3> When you feel unmotivated, you end up becoming burned out. Burnout occurs when you feel so unmotivated 
		that it will affect your mental health and lose hope that things will improve. It can lead to certain mental health conditions like
		depression and anxiety.</p>
		<p><h3> Procrastination: </h3> Procrastination is an act of putting off assignments until the last minute or past the deadline. When we 
		are unmotivated, we do not feel like doing our assignments. Instead, we engage in doing what we think makes us happy and feel 
		relatively stress-free like watching television, surfing through the internet, playing video games, etc.</p> <img src= "https://media.istockphoto.com

		<p>This happens due to laziness. 
		When we are lazy, we often come up with excuses like "Deadline is so far away, why can't I do it tomorrow?", or "I'll do it later, 
		assignment isn't due for the next two weeks".</p> 
		<p>Another factor that leads to procrastination is distraction. As humans, it is normal for us to undergo temptations but it is not easy 
		to overcome them. Likewise, when we are performing our daily duties, we can be easily be distracted by what video we love to watch, the 
		places we desire to go to or even our past negative experiences that hinder us from working hard for future improvements. At the end of 
		the day, we often find ourselves giving in to such distractions which could lead to failure.</p>

		<h3> Effects of poor time management </h3>
		<p><h3> Poor quality of work: </h3> When trying to complete your tasks at the very last minute, you could not have had much time left to 
		cross check your work for any mistakes or make any last-minute changes in order to improve your work.</p>
		<p><h3> Missed Deadlines: </h3> It happens to the best of us. Sometimes, you take in numerous tasks and you will inevitably miss the deadline 
		on one or more of these jobs. That is why it is important to set up any prioritized schedule and to cut out
		any task that is not suitable for you to handle.</p>
		<p><h3>Poor working Relationships:</h3> Your poor time management could potentionally impact others negatively, for instance, when you are late 
		for a meeting. To avoid such awkward moments, it is best to set up a schedule that will enable you to meet all your basic 
		requirements.</p>
		<p><h3>A bad reputation:</h3> Your employer's or clients' expectations and impressions of you suffer if they can't count on you to finish projects 
		on time. Clients will probably go elsewhere if they can't count on you to complete tasks on schedule.</p>

		<h3>Tips of Effective Time Management</h3>

		<h3>1. Set goals correctly</h3>
		<p>Set goals that are achievable and measurable. Use the SMART method when setting goals. In essence, 
		make sure the goals you set are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely.<p>
		<h3>2. Prioritize wisely</h3>
		<p>Prioritize tasks based on importance and urgency. For example, look at your daily tasks and determine which are:</p>
		<p>Important and urgent: Do these tasks right away.</p>
		<p>Important but not urgent: Decide when to do these tasks.</p>
		<p>Urgent but not important: Delegate these tasks if possible.</p>
		<p>Not urgent and not important: Set these aside to do later.</p>

		<h3>3. Set a time limit to complete a task</h3>
		Setting time constraints for completing tasks helps you be more focused and efficient. 
		Making the small extra effort to decide on how much time you need to allot for each task 
		can also help you recognize potential problems before they arise. That way you can make plans for dealing with them.

		<p>For example, assume you need to write up five reviews in time for a meeting. However, you realize that you’ll only be able to 
		get four of them done in the time remaining before the meeting. If you become aware of this fact well in advance, 
		you may be able to easily delegate writing up one of the reviews to someone else.</p>

		However, if you hadn’t bothered to do a time check on your tasks beforehand, you might have ended up not realizing your time problem 
		until just an hour before the meeting. At that point, it might be considerably more difficult to find someone to delegate one of the reviews to, 
		and more difficult for them to fit the task into their day, too.

		<h3>4. Take a break between tasks</h3>
		When doing a lot of tasks without a break, it is harder to stay focused and motivated. 
		Allow some downtime between tasks to clear your head and refresh yourself. Consider grabbing a brief nap, going for a short walk, or meditating.

		<h3>5. Organize yourself</h3>
		Utilize your calendar for more long-term time management. Write down the deadlines for projects, or for tasks that are part of completing the overall project. 
		Think about which days might be best to dedicate to specific tasks. For example, you might need to plan a meeting to discuss cash flow on a day when you know 
		the company CFO is available.

		<h3>6. Remove non-essential tasks/activities</h3>
		It is important to remove excess activities or tasks. Determine what is significant and what deserves your time.
		Removing non-essential tasks/activities frees up more of your time to be spent on genuinely important things.

		<h3>7. Plan ahead</h3>
		<p>Make sure you start every day with a clear idea of what you need to do – what needs to get done that day. Consider making it a habit to, at the end of each workday, 
		go ahead and write out your “to-do” list for the next workday. That way you can hit the ground running the next morning.</p>
